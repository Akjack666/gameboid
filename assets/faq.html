<a id="q1"><h3>Q: How do I get games (aka. ROMs)?</h3></a>
<p>A: The emulator does not include any games in itself. If you own an existing game, you may want to obtain a copy of that game by searching the web.

<a id="q2"><h3>Q: Can I download games directly from my phone?</h3></a>
<p>A: Theoretically, yes. But the Android browser is proved to have problem downloading games from certain sites. So the recommended way would be to download on the computer, and then copy to the SD Card. To copy games to the SD Card:
<ol>
<li/>Connect the phone to a computer through a USB cable.
<li/>On the phone, expand the system notification area, and select '<b>USB connected</b>' -&gt; '<b>Mount</b>'.
<li/>On the computer, copy your game files to the mounted SD Card.
<li/>On the phone, expand the system notification area, and select '<b>Turn off USB storage</b>' -&gt; '<b>Turn off</b>'.
</ol>

<a id="q3"><h3>Q: Can I directly play a .zip ROM without extracting first?</h3></a>
<p>A: Yes. The emulator can properly handle zipped ROMs.

<a id="q4"><h3>Q: The emulator can't seem to recognize my .7z ROMs.</h3></a>
<p>A: .7z ROMs are simply not supported by the emulator. You have to extract the actual ROM files from it before you can play them on the emulator.

<a id="q5"><h3>Q: I can't press the on-screen D-Pad and buttons at the same time.</h3></a>
<p>A: It requires the multi-touch API support that is available only on Android 2.0 and later. And of course, you must have a multi-touch capable screen!
